// Write a function named setAlarm which receives two parameters. The first parameter, employed, is true whenever you are employed and the second parameter, vacation is true whenever you are on vacation.

// The function should return true if you are employed and not on vacation (because these are the circumstances under which you need to set an alarm). It should return false otherwise.

const setAlarm = (employed, vacation) => employed === true && vacation === false ? true : false


// Your function takes two arguments:

// current father's age (years)
// current age of his son (years)
// Сalculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).


function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
    let twiceAge = sonYearsOld * 2
    let difference = dadYearsOld - twiceAge
    return Math.sign(difference) === -1 ? difference * -1 : difference

//  You ask a small girl,"How old are you?" She always says, "x years old", where x is a random number between 0 and 9.

// Write a program that returns the girl's age (0-9) as an integer.

// Assume the test input string is always a valid string. For example, the test input may be "1 year old" or "5 years old". The first character in the string is always a number.

const getAge = inputString => Number(inputString[0])



// All of the animals are having a feast! Each animal is bringing one dish. There is just one rule: the dish must start and end with the same letters as the animal's name. For example, the great blue heron is bringing garlic naan and the chickadee is bringing chocolate cake.

// Write a function feast that takes the animal's name and dish as arguments and returns true or false to indicate whether the beast is allowed to bring the dish to the feast.

// Assume that beast and dish are always lowercase strings, and that each has at least two letters. beast and dish may contain hyphens and spaces, but these will not appear at the beginning or end of the string. They will not contain numerals.

const feast = (beast, dish) => beast[0] === dish[0] && beast[beast.length-1] === dish[dish.length-1]


// The Story:
// Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.

// Task Overview:
// You have to write a function that accepts three parameters:

// cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
// on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
// wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.
// If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.


function enough(cap, on, wait) {
    return Math.sign(wait - (cap - on)) === -1 ? 0 : wait - (cap - on)
  }
