# CodeWars Challenges: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.codewars.com/users/Blars-git" >Visit Here</a> 

A repository filled with codewars challenges (kata). I Push at least 5 solutions every week.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewar! 

## Optimizations

I consistently refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I have learned from doing daily coding challenges is that it takes time and dedication to master subjects. Everyday I continue to chip away at learning more things about this wonderful world of code.
